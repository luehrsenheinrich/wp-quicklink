# This workflow tests if the commit or pr meets the requirements and deploys to
# a development server upon success.
# It assumes that `npm install`, `composer install` and `npx grunt release` are valid commands.
# The action expects a valid zip file in the `./update/` folder and the `slug` key in the
# `package.json` to be set.
